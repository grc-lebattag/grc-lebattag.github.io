					<h1> About </h1>
				
					<p>  We are Nic & Paolo Battaglini, owners of Cowabunga Coffee. We spent over 12 years dreaming, planning, learning and working in all things 
                        coffee with the hope that someday we would start a shop of our own. In December of 2001, we launched Cowabunga Coffee by Pismo Beach. In August 
                        of 2011, we opened our second Cowabunga Coffee location near UCSB.  We now have over 30 wonderful employees, and love that the community has made 
                        Cowabunga Coffee one of the most sought after destinations on the California Coast. Thank you so much to all of you who have made this possible.
                        Our goal has always been to create inspiring spaces, with great people and amazing products, in a way that truly adds value to the community around us. 
                        We hope you love it here!</p>
