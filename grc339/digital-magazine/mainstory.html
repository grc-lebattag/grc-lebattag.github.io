            <p>A cotton candy burrito (a.k.a. ice cream burrito, cotton candy ice cream burrito) is a
               hybrid dessert made up of ice cream, cotton candy and toppings. Multiple ice cream scoops
               are placed side-by-side on a flattened cloud of pink, yellow, and/or baby blue cotton 
               candy. Then, the ice cream is covered in various ice cream toppings like cereal, candy, 
               sprinkles, sparkly “unicorn dust” and other sweet, visually appealing edible accents.  
               Lastly, everything is wrapped like a burrito in the cotton candy “tortilla” and cut in 
               half to expose the colorful filling.
            </p>
            <p>You can find these satisfyingly sweet desserts across the country.  Usually, they are served by 
               food vendors at outdoor markets (i.e. farmer’s markets, night markets, state & county fairs, etc.),
               or at trendy dessert shops.  Here are some places throughout the US that serve these made-to-order 
               cotton candy burritos.

            <p>You’ll have to head off the Strip to find one of the wildest burgers in town: a deep-fried sushi 
               burger. Inspired by a group of foodies looking for Instagram’s infamous sushi burger, the chefs 
               at Jjanga Steak & Sushi have created a deep-fried version of the burger, which you can get at 
               their location in Southern Terrace. These burgers start with buns made out of sticky sushi rice, 
               which are pressed into shape using a hamburger patty press. From there, the buns are covered 
               in panko bread crumbs before cooks deep-fry the hell of out of them. With the buns complete, 
               the burger is assembled by piling on heaps of spicy crab and chunky spicy tuna, dousing the 
               sushi mountain in spicy aioli and tangy eel sauce, then garnishing with gloriously green 
               seaweed salad. It's now the most popular burger on Jjanga's menu and has become the 
               restaurant's signature dish.
