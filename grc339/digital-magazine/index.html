               <h3>Strange Foods in Los Vegas</h3>
               <p>
                  Without a doubt, Nevada is one of the most unique states in the US. Lonely highways are dotted with 
                  cowboy hangouts, and century-old saloons buzz with hushed conspiracy theories of a crashed UFO spacecraft. 
                  Futuristic cities fizzle with the whir of spinning slot machines, while tumbleweeds blow through desolate 
                  Gold Rush ghost towns. Wherever you go, whatever you eat, expect the unexpected.

                  <h3>Strange Foods in San Francisco</h3>
                  <p>
                     San Francisco is a city that's always prided itself on being unusual. One of the best ways to see the city and 
                     experience this yourself is to eat your way through it. Here are just some of San Francisco's most unique dining 
                     experiences. 
                  </p>
                  <p>Andrew Zimmern is notorious for traveling the world eating weird dishes. From putrefied shark in Iceland to rectum 
                     sausage in Kazakhstan, he’s digested his fair share of bizarre and unappealing foods. On a trip to San Francisco, 
                     Andrew ate his way around our plethora of international restaurants, sampling an array of strange delicacies. We’re 
                     rounding up a few of the places he dined and some of the weird things he feasted on, plus adding a few of our own 
                     that we think the food pro should try on his next trip here.
                  </p>
                  <p>San Francisco is definitely abnormal when compared to the average American city, so it’s no surprise it’s also home 
                     to a number of strange places to dine. Check out this list of the weirdest restaurants in San Francisco and make 
                     your next dining experience an eccentric one.
                  </p>
                  <p>San Francisco has been a renowned restaurant town almost from its birth. Today’s eateries are probably unsurpassed 
                     in the quality of their food, but there is one area in which they fall lamentably short of their predecessors: weirdness.
                  <p>A striking number of San Francisco’s old-time restaurants were offbeat, unusual or just plain bizarre. The following is a 
                     brief list of some of the city’s oddest eateries.
                  </p>
                  <p>We take our food very seriously in San Francisco, but we also like to have a little fun with it. Pairing foods and ingredients 
                     to make strange food combinations may just be a Bay Area pastime. San Franciscans love their mouthwatering breads, seafood, 
                     burritos, ice cream, and fries, all with a truly local, truly awesome spin. And for better or worse, we have no qualms about 
                     standing in line or waking up early for them. 
                  </p>
                  <p>San Francisco Bay Area is not only home to some of the most stunning landmarks in the country, it’s also home to dozens of weird 
                     restaurants that offer a variety of delectable dishes. From a ‘dining in the dark’ restaurant to a café littered with troll 
                     dolls and dildos, these weird restaurants in the Bay Area will surely make a tourist’s dining experience an eccentric one.
                  </p>
                  <p>Overall, San Francisco is an exciting city and the food matches that energy. If you are looking to branch out and try new foods,
                     this is a great city to find yourself in.

                     What we consider weird may be another person’s ordinary, and sometimes we
